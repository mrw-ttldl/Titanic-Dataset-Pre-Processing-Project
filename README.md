The sinking of the RMS( Royal Mail Ship) Titanic is one of the most painful shipwrecks in history. On 15 April 1912, on her maiden voyage, the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank, killing 2224 passengers and 1502 crew. This tragic disaster has shocked the international community.One of the reasons the accident caused casualties was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there were some elements of chance to survive, some classes of people (such as women, children, and upper class) were more likely to survive than others.

I made an exploratory data analysis project using the data set about this event.The data has been split into two groups:

* training set (train.csv) : We will use it to build our machine learning model

## Dataset Information

1. **Survived**: Survivors on Titanic ship 1, survivors 0, TARGET
1. **PassengerId**: Passengers id
1. **Pclass**: Economic status : 1st = Upper 2nd = Middle 3rd = Lower
1. **Name**:  Passengers names
1. **Sex**: Male / Female
1. **Age**: Ages of Passengers
1. **SlipSp**: brother / sister (1 or 0)
1. **Parch**: parent / child (1 or 0)
1. **Ticket**: Ticket numbers 
1. **Fare**: Ticket price
1. **Cabin**: Cabin number
1. **Embarked**:  Port names (C, Q, S) C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
1. **Survived** = TARGET VALUE
