The sinking of the RMS( Royal Mail Ship) Titanic is one of the most painful shipwrecks in history. On 15 April 1912, on her maiden voyage, the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank, killing 2224 passengers and 1502 crew. This tragic disaster has shocked the international community.One of the reasons the accident caused casualties was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there were some elements of chance to survive, some classes of people (such as women, children, and upper class) were more likely to survive than others.
